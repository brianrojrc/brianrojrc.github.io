    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>I'm currently studying Electrical Engineering and Computer Science with a minor in Mathematics at the University of Central Florida. I started programming at age 11 with Objective-C and Python, and later earned an Associate of Arts in Finance and Engineering at Indian River State College.</p>
    
    <p>Accepted to both UF and UCF, I chose to become a Knight (Go Knights!). I deepened my knowledge of math and financial markets in my early college years before pivoting to Computer Engineering with guidance from Kris Sidal at Ambrus Group and Agustin Lebron who was a trader at Jane Street.</p>
    
    <p>Currently, I'm interested in using neural networks (LSTMs, CNNs) to predict volatility more accurately than GARCH models as an undergraduate researcher. Outside of academics, I enjoy chess, cooking, and running with my uni's track club.</p>
