            <h3>Roots & Journey</h3>
            <p>Born and raised in St. Lucie, Florida, I'm a first-generation college student from an immigrant family. After being accepted to Cornell University, financial constraints led me to start at Indian River State College (IRSC) while helping with my family's business. After earning my AA and being accepted to both UCF and UF, I chose to become a Knight at UCF, where I'm now pursuing a BS in Computer Engineering and Mathematics.</p>

            <h3>Early Interests</h3>
            <p>From a young age, I've been drawn to books, puzzles, computers, and mathematics. My curiosity led me to explore iOS device security, jailbreaking, hardware tweaking, and eventually machine learning and finance. At 18, I discovered a passion for financial markets, which initially guided my academic path.</p>

            <h3>The Pivot</h3>
            <p>I initially majored in finance due to my fascination with markets. However, after seeking advice from professionals like Agustin Lebron from Jane Street and Kris Sidal from Ambrus Group, I realized I should pursue the passion I'd always had: engineering. Though this decision set me back two years academically, it was the right choice for my long-term goals.</p>

            <h3>Mentorship</h3>
            <p>Before transferring to UCF, I had the privilege of studying under Dr. Zheng, my physics professor at IRSC. His unique teaching style and mentorship introduced me to advanced problem-solving methods that reshaped my approach to education and deepened my passion for learning.</p>
