    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p class="description">
        A bit about me, I was born and raised in Florida as a first generation. 
        Throughout my life, I’ve moved between Fort Pierce and Jupiter. I attended IRSC, where I earned an Associate of Applied Science in Finance and Engineering. 
        Later, I was accepted into both the University of Florida and the University of Central Florida. I chose to become a Knight (Go Knights!), 
        and I spent years learning advanced math and the financial markets through self-study and the guidance of my professors at IRSC. I decided to switch from Finance to Engineering because a Finance degree wouldn’t lead me to my desired path (it wasn’t challenging enough either). 
        I received help from Kris Sidal from Ambrus Group and Agustin Lebron from Jane Street to pursue Computer Engineering. I love cooking steak and running when I’m not working or studying.
