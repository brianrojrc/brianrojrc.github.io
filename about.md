    <h2>Background</h2>
    
    <p>I was born and raised in St. Lucie, Florida. After high school, I received acceptances from Cornell University and several Florida state colleges, but financial constraints led me to pursue my education at Indian River State College (IRSC) while helping support my family's businesses. After earning my AA, I was accepted to both UCF and UF, ultimately choosing UCF, where I'm currently pursuing a BS in Computer Engineering with a minor in Mathematics.</p>  

    <p>From a young age, I've been curious about everything from philosophy to medicine, but mathematics and engineering have always gravitated me the most. I spent learning in my teens how Apple's operating systems work, diving into both hardware and software, eventually my curiosity evolved into security research during high school, where I learned about system vulnerabilities. In my early college years, I was introduced to the financial markets particulary into derivatives and volatility, this pushed me to learn machine learning to better understand market behavior. I initially majored in finance at IRSC, but after conversations with professionals like Agustín LeBron, a former trader at Jane Street, and Kris Sidal, a portfolio manager at Ambrus Group, I realized that while I was fascinated by financial applications, I needed to pursue engineering. Switching majors set me back two years, but it was the right decision for my long term goals.</p> 
    
    <p>Before transferring to UCF, I had the privilege of studying under Dr. Zheng, my physics professor at IRSC. His teaching impacted me, introducing methods that reshaped how I approach problem solving and deepened my passion for mathematics and physics.</p> 

    <p>Currently, I conduct undergraduate research in machine learning at UCF. For the upcoming year I plan to intern at a robotics company, and I'm working toward pursuing an MS in Electrical Engineering at Stanford University. Outside my studies, I tutor students in STEM subjects as a Kumon math coach, participate in my local run club, explore thrift stores and museums, and enjoy cooking steak while listening to philosophy debates and nutrition podcasts.</p>
