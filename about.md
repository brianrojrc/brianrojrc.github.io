    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>A little about me: I was born and raised in St. Lucie, Florida. After high school, I was accepted to Cornell University, but due to financial constraints, I began my education at Indian River State College (IRSC) while helping my families business. After earning my AA, I was accepted to both UCF and UF, I made my decision to choose UCF, where I’m currently pursuing a BS in Computer Engineering and Mathematics.
As a first-generation college student from an immigrant family, I’m the first in my family to pursue higher education. Given our lack of wealth and academic background, earning this degree is a significant achievement for my family.

From a young age, I’ve been drawn to books, puzzles, and anything related to computers and math. My curiosity led me to tweaking hardware, jailbreaking and finding bugs on IOS devices, and eventually exploring machine learning and finance. Initially, I majored in finance, due to having the passionate for the markets when I turned 18. However, after seeking advice from professionals like Agustin Lebron from Jane Street and Kris Sidal from Ambrus Group, I realized I should've majored the passion I always had; which was engineering. Though this decision set me back two years academically, it was the right choice for my long-term goals.

Before transferring to UCF, I had the privilege of studying under Dr. Zheng, my physics professor at IRSC. His unique teaching style and his mentorship impacted me, introducing advanced methods that reshaped how I approach solving problems and deepened my passion for education.
Currently, I’m a machine learning researcher at UCF and an engineer with NASA’s spacesuit program. Outside of my studies, I tutor students in STEM subjects, run with my track club, and enjoy cooking steak.

    <p>Accepted to both UF and UCF, I chose to become a Knight (Go Knights!). I deepened my knowledge of math and financial markets in my early college years before pivoting to Computer Engineering with guidance from Kris Sidal at Ambrus Group and Agustin Lebron who was a trader at Jane Street.</p>
    
    <p>Outside of academics, I enjoy chess, reading books, working out and cooking, and running with my track club.</p>
