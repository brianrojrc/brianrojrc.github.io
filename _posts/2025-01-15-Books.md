# Books That I enjoyed Reading

Since switching from Finance to Computer Engineering, I've consumed dozens of books across mathematics, programming, and quantitative finance. Here are the ones that fundamentally changed how I approach problems.

## Mathematics & Theory

**"Linear Algebra Done Right" by Sheldon Axler**
Transformed how I think about vector spaces and linear transformations. Axler's approach avoids determinants until late in the book, building intuition first. Crucial for understanding dimensionality reduction in financial data.

**"The Rust Programming Language" by Klabnik & Nichols**
Rust's ownership model changed how I think about memory safety and concurrent programming. Now my go-to language for high-performance trading infrastructure.

## Finance & Markets

**"Options, Futures, and Other Derivatives" by John Hull**
The standard derivatives textbook, this is the bible of knowing how the derivatives in the markets. This book was recommended from a volatility trader from Twitter formally known as Flowdamentals.

## Problem-Solving Philosophy

**"How to Solve It" by George Polya**
Classic problem-solving methodology. Polya's four-step approach (understand, plan, execute, reflect) applies whether I'm debugging kernel exploits or developing trading algorithms.

**"The Art of Problem Solving" by Larson**
Mathematical contest preparation, but the techniques generalize. Particularly useful for approaching optimization problems in both security research and quantitative finance.

## Why These Books Matter

Each book taught me to think differently about fundamental concepts. Shreve showed me that financial mathematics is just applied probability theory. Bryant revealed that understanding hardware makes you a better programmer. O'Hara demonstrated that markets have deep structural patterns worth studying.

The common thread: these authors don't just present informationâ€”they teach you to think like an expert in their field. They're investments in how you approach problems, not just collections of facts.

## What's Next

I will later provide more books that I loved reading that are outside of my work, I will be diving into fiction books as well.
