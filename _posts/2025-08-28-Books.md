# Books That I enjoyed Reading
Here are some book recommedations that helped me learned the mathematics, finanical markets and physics. 

## Mathematics & Theory

*"Linear Algebra Done Right" by Sheldon Axler*

Transformed how I think about vector spaces and linear transformations. Axler's approach avoids determinants until late in the book, building intuition first. Crucial for understanding dimensionality reduction in financial data.

*"Introduction to Classical Mechanics" By David Morin*

This book was suggested by Dr. Zheng a professor I admired that took physics back at IRSC, this book had very intense and rigorous problems but it really sharpen my problem solving skills and lead me to solve any classical mechanics problem that you would encounter in a newtonian physics course. (Not for intro students)

*"The Rust Programming Language" by Klabnik & Nichols*

Rust's ownership model changed how I think about memory safety and concurrent programming. Now my go-to language for high-performance trading infrastructure.

## Finance & Markets

*"Options, Futures, and Other Derivatives" by John Hull*

The standard derivatives textbook, this is the bible of knowing how the derivatives in the markets. This book was recommended from a volatility trader from Twitter formally known as Flowdamentals.

*"Volatility Trading" by Euan Sinclair*

This is a first book I picked up the first year I started learning the finanical markets. I was first confused and realized that it was too advanced for me when starting out but as I got to know more, this book is an absolute gem into knowing what volatility is and trying to model volatility.


## Problem-Solving Philosophy

*"How to Solve It" by George Polya*
Classic problem-solving methodology. Polya's four-step approach (understand, plan, execute, reflect) applies whether I'm debugging kernel exploits or developing trading algorithms.

*"The Art of Problem Solving" by Larson*
Mathematical contest preparation, but the techniques generalize. Particularly useful for approaching optimization problems in both security research and quantitative finance.

## What's Next

I will later provide more books that I loved reading that are outside of my work going more into fiction as well. I believe that fiction books can help us learn how to navigate through the everyday life from personal life to work better than self help books.
