# Books That I enjoyed Reading

Since switching from Finance to Computer Engineering, I've consumed dozens of books across mathematics, programming, and quantitative finance. Here are the ones that fundamentally changed how I approach problems.

## Mathematics & Theory

*"Linear Algebra Done Right" by Sheldon Axler*
Transformed how I think about vector spaces and linear transformations. Axler's approach avoids determinants until late in the book, building intuition first. Crucial for understanding dimensionality reduction in financial data.

*"The Rust Programming Language" by Klabnik & Nichols*
Rust's ownership model changed how I think about memory safety and concurrent programming. Now my go-to language for high-performance trading infrastructure.

## Finance & Markets

*"Options, Futures, and Other Derivatives" by John Hull*
The standard derivatives textbook, this is the bible of knowing how the derivatives in the markets. This book was recommended from a volatility trader from Twitter formally known as Flowdamentals.

## Problem-Solving Philosophy

*"How to Solve It" by George Polya*
Classic problem-solving methodology. Polya's four-step approach (understand, plan, execute, reflect) applies whether I'm debugging kernel exploits or developing trading algorithms.

*"The Art of Problem Solving" by Larson*
Mathematical contest preparation, but the techniques generalize. Particularly useful for approaching optimization problems in both security research and quantitative finance.

## What's Next

I will later provide more books that I loved reading that are outside of my work going more into fiction as well. I believe that fiction books can help us learn how to navigate through the everyday life from personal life to work better than self help books.
